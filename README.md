# KidSmash Mac

A port of [KidSmash](http://github.com/qrush/kidsmash), based on [BabySmash](http://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/). I wanted to have a little playground for Swift, so here it is!

## Features

* Locks out of process switching so tiny hands can smash freely
* Lots of colors, numbers, shapes, etc
* Command-Q or type "quit" to quit

## Install

Requires XCode 6.1+. Just build and run! Exporting as an app doesn't work too well yet.
